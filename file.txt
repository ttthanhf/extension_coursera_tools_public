1. Stephen Brookfield (1995), in his analysis of why critical reflection is important to teaching, suggests that "an uncritical stance towards our practice sets us up for a lifetime of frustration" (para 2). He suggests this is because teachers can have a different view of their classrooms to what is actually going on: they are unaware. This contradiction fascinates me.3. What we had learnt in our education theory courses didn't quite match up to real-life experience. Having my supervisor give me notes at the end really helped me in evaluating my teaching and planning the next lesson. This, coupled with my own observations of my students allowed me to more closely align what Brookfield would call the "meaning and significance" (para 2) I intended for the lesson to what the students took from it.
